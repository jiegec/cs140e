By using these traits, the default implementation included in these traits reuses much code and allow for cleaner implementation for `Volatile'-s. However, the `new' methods have to have different type signature for different semantics, so they cannot be put into a trait, but they still provide a similar interface. It eases using the library and prevents the library author from making errors.
